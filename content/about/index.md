I am a maths facilitator by profession and a children’s illustrator by passion.  

I recently graduated from Azim Premji University with a Master’s degree in Education. My time in University exploring collage art, glass mosaic, and children’s literature pulled me into art and children's storytelling using illustration. My purpose is to make maths and other things understandable to my cute audience. Through these explorations, I created various art pieces and even wrote and illustrated my own children’s book.  

### Current Work
Currently, I am working with [Seed2Sapling Education](https://www.s2seducation.com/) in Bengaluru. As part of my work, I help develop maths textbooks and try to make maths fun for kids. These books are used by various schools across the country.  
I also work with schools for their development, spend time with students of different age groups, and participate in discussions with teachers. This helps me get a better understanding of education as we talk and try to find ways to solve challenges in the classroom. In everything I do, I try to make learning more fun, interactive, engaging, and enquiry-based.  

### Interests
I don’t have a formal background in art or story writing; I just love doing it. I enjoy exploring different art forms, and whenever I find something interesting, I try to learn it.  
I discovered my interest in story writing and illustrating recently through a course I did during my MA called ‘Children’s Literature’ and an internship with Coast and Oceans of Life. During that internship, I worked as a public art intern, where I illustrated a 4-panel story titled Where’s the Dolphin, inspired by [Barroux’s Where’s the Elephant](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/536559/wheres-the-elephant-by-barroux-illustrated-by-barroux/). That experience was very enriching for me; it was the first time my work was exhibited.
